								<p>As you already have a good understanding of the type of work involved, you should start to compile a list of employers to apply to. Sending 100 badly researched applications is not the most effective application strategy. View the employment sectors section of the LSE website to expand your search from the well-known larger organisations to the smaller harder to find organisations.</p>
								<p>Speaking to LSE alumni working for a range of organisations can be helpful in expanding your list of possible employers and give you a head start for the application and interview process. You may even find work experience off the back of it! Set up informational interviews with LSE alumni within the sector. You can contact alumni through the LSE Alumni Association Official Group on LinkedIn.</p>

							<p class="no-selection">Please select one or more decision making barriers from the section above.</p>
							<div class="advice 1" id="perfect-job">
								<h4 class="toggler">Looking for the perfect job? This may not actually exist!</h4>
								<ul class="barrier-list"></ul>
								<p>Remember that there isn't a single perfect career for you. There are usually a range of possibilities that would suit you. Looking for the perfect job can actually prevent you from trialing some really exciting opportunities. The perfect job rarely exists and your preferences and the nature of the job are likely to change over time. Don't make the mistake of passing up great work experience opportunities as the role does not match every marker. You will find you have to compromise on some things; this is not an exact science.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="advice 2" id="wrong-decision">
								<h4 class="toggler">Afraid of making the wrong decision? Trial it – you've got nothing to lose</h4>
								<ul class="barrier-list"></ul>
								<p>Remember, the career choice you make now is not a life sentence! Most LSE graduates will make several career changes throughout their working lives. If the first role you do does not work out, then you will have a better understanding of what is important to you when you make the next choice. Focus on a few ideas at a time. Remember that you can always review and adapt your plans and goals as they develop and take shape. Why not use your time at university to try out a variety of roles so you can get a flavour of the work involved?</p>
							</div>
							<div class="advice 3" id="compromise">
								<h4 class="toggler">Compromise may be the key</h4>
								<ul class="barrier-list"></ul>
								<p>If one particular factor, like location or using languages, has a major priority in your choice of career, you may have to compromise on some other factors to help you get started. For example, you may have to take a job which is not in your chosen field, in order to make use of your languages in the first instance. Alternatively, in the short term you may have to compromise on your main deciding factor in career choice to enable you to realise your ambition longer term. For example, if your main priority is to live in London, but you also want to work in international development, you may have to gain experience in the field first, to enable you to move back to London at a later stage.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="advice 4" id="people-think">
								<h4 class="toggler">Worried about what people will think?</h4>
								<ul class="barrier-list"></ul>
								<p>If you are concerned about what other people think then you need to assess how important these influences are for you. Is it that important for you to work in a similar sector to your friends? In career discussions we commonly hear students admitting to applying for a role as many of their friends were also applying. You have to be genuinely interested in a role to actually enjoy the work so does it really matter what your LSE friends are doing? More significant can be the influences of parents or partners – you need to be honest with yourself and with them about how important their views are.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="advice opt-out" id="opt-out">
								<h4 class="toggler">Are you opting out?</h4>
								<ul class="barrier-list"></ul>
								<p>It often feels easier to put off making the big decisions. Even if you are planning on looking for a job following your exams there are still small things you can be doing whilst at university to make the process easier when you finish. If you plan to travel – make sure you know what your first steps will be when you return. In reality, very few people find 'themselves' or their ideal career whilst daydreaming on a beach!</p>
							</div>
							<div class="advice 6" id="confidence">
								<h4 class="toggler">Do you lack confidence?</h4>
								<ul class="barrier-list"></ul>
								<p>If you lack confidence in yourself, try to be realistic. Remember you will graduate from a globally respected university with a range of transferable academic skills and personal qualities. Review your PDAM to gain a clearer understanding of what you have already engaged in. Most careers can be achieved through gaining a range of work experience – it's about finding the right experience to get you there!</p>
