            The first step in career planning is usually self-assessment. The better you know yourself, the easier it will be to find a fulfilling career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-assessment activities can include reflection, asking for feedback from people you know well, completing personality assessment tools or making lists that can bring to light important information about your skills, abilities, values and motivations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people find self-reflection easy whereas others find it more difficult. The activities below should help you get started.

            Careers research can be broken down into three areas:
          </p>
          <ul class="bulletlist">
            <li>
              understanding of job sectors/industries
            </li>
            <li>
              understanding of roles
            </li>
            <li>
              understanding of organisations/employers
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once you have completed research into these areas you will be better prepared to create tailored applications and find roles which match your skills and values. You may need to make small compromises when initially embarking on a career.

For example, you may want to work for a particular sector but you are unlikely to enjoy every role that sector offers. Alternatively you may decide that the typical activities related to a role is what is important and you would be happy to do this role within any sector.

                    Tailoring your applications is one of the best ways to ensure you stand out against the competition. Make sure that your research is demonstrated in your application.

                    Try to start early and don't wait for the deadlines. The research you conduct on an employer at the application stage is vital and may determine whether you are selected for interview. We understand that research takes time but the research you complete now will not go to waste - it all helps to build your understanding of a sector.

                    Doing employer research prior to making applications is essential. If you have not tailored your CV and applications to the employers you're applying to, you are unlikely to be successful in your job search.

                    If you were hiring someone, it is more likely you would pick someone who had spent time researching you, your working style and your preferences over someone who had put no thought into it.

            Decision making plays a key role in career planning and having too many choices will confuse you and slow you down. We all approach decision making in different ways. Some people favour following their instincts, some take a 'pot luck' approach, and a fortunate few are lucky enough to have always known what they want to do!
          </p>
          <p>
            In our experience, action occurs quickest when people recognise barriers to decision making which can often result from their own attitude rather than external factors.

                  Lots of people find it easy to make decisions. From your research and reflection in sections 1 and 2 you might already have a really clear idea of what role, industry or employer you want to focus on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you're not finding decision making difficult then you can skip this section. However you might still find the further support and advice useful.

                      Remember that there isn't a single perfect career for you. There are usually a range of possibilities that would suit you. Looking for the perfect job can actually prevent you from trialling some really exciting opportunities. The perfect job rarely exists and your preferences and the nature of the job are likely to change over time. Don't make the mistake of passing up great work experience opportunities if the role does not match all of your criteria. You will find you have to compromise on some things; choosing a career is not an exact science.

                    <p>
                      Remember that the career choice you make now is not for life! Most LSE graduates will make several career changes throughout their working lives. If the first role you do does not work out, then you will have a better understanding of what is important to you when you make the next choice. Focus on a few ideas at a time.

                    <p>
                      Remember that you can always review and adapt your plans and goals as they develop and take shape. Why not use your time at university to try out a variety of roles so you can get a flavour of the work involved?

                    <p>
                      If one particular factor, like job location or using languages, has a major priority in your choice of career, you may have to compromise on some other factors to help you get started. For example, you may have to take a job which is not in your chosen sector, in order to make use of your languages in the first instance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Alternatively, in the short term you may have to compromise on your main deciding factor in career choice to enable you to realise your ambition longer term. For example, if your main priority is to live in London, but you also want to work in international development, you may have to gain experience in the field first, to enable you to move back to London at a later stage.

                      In career discussions we commonly hear students admitting to applying for certain sectors or roles as many of their friends or class mates were also applying. You have to be genuinely interested in a role to actually enjoy the work. Happiness and success in your career is personal and not related to what your friends are doing.

                    <p>
                      More significant can be the influences of parents or partners. You need to be honest with yourself and with them about how important their views are.

                      It often feels easier to put off making the big decisions. Even if you are planning on looking for a job following your exams there are still small things you can be doing whilst at university to make the process easier when you finish. For example you could try out a role of interest by arranging a week's work shadowing or you could take up a position of responsibility within a society or club. This will help you to identify areas of career interest and develop your skills now.

      Career Builder can be picked up again at any time. The tool works best if you dip in and out or the various sections at different stages in your career planning. It's important to recognise that your feelings towards careers and your current situation will change even while you are at university.
